Used to automate annoying tasks for the UofT Kendo Tournament

Originally made for 2020 uoft tournament on Saturday, March 14th, 2020.

For any future presidents or tournament planners, you are free to use this to automate many of the annoying repetivitve tasks involved with the tournament. There are instructions attached on how to use everything, but if something stops working or you just need general advice on how to run the tournament, feel free to contact me at francesca.ho459@gmail.com. I was VP for 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 and both times I pretty much ran the tournament, so don't bother asking those presidents for advice lol.
